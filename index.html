				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>Minesweeper</b></div>
				is a logic-based computer game where the objective is to uncover tiles on a grid, potentially hiding mines,
				while avoiding detonating any of them. The rules of Minesweeper are relatively straightforward:
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>1. GameBoard:</b></div>
				Minesweeper is typically played on a square grid divided into tiles.
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>2. Mines:</b></div>
				Mines are placed on the board, and their number is predetermined before the game starts. The player's goal is to
				mark all the mines on the board without accidentally uncovering them.
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>3. Marking Tiles:</b></div>
				Players can mark tiles on the board as potentially containing mines using flags or other markers. This helps
				prevent accidental mine detonations.
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>4. Uncovering Tiles:</b></div>
				Players start by uncovering a single tile on the board. When a tile is uncovered, it reveals how many mines are
				adjacent to it. Based on these hints, players make decisions about their next moves.
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>5. Numbers on Tiles:</b></div>
				If a number is displayed on an uncovered tile, it indicates how many mines are adjacent to that tile. Players
				can use these numbers to logically deduce where mines are not present and where caution is required.
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>6. Winning:</b></div>
				Players win the game by marking all the mines on the board. Marking all the mines is the primary objective of
				the game.
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="text-secondary-color"><b>7. Losing:</b></div>
				Players lose the game if they uncover a tile with a mine. In such a case, the board is revealed, and the game is
				lost.
			</div>
			<div>
				Minesweeper requires logical thinking, deduction, and risk assessment. Solving more complex Minesweeper puzzles
				can be challenging because it involves making more advanced decisions based on the information available on the
				board.
